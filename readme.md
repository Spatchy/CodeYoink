# CodeYoink

As a programmer, a large chunk of your time probably involves finding just the right code snippet  to use in your work, school or personal project, but isn't highlighting those code blocks to copy them tedious? 

Whether or not you answered 'yes' to that question, you'll never want to do things the old way again after you install CodeYoink! Simply click the text in any code block to yoink* it for yourself!

CodeYoink allows one-click copy and paste from any HTML code block and saves your yoinked code snippets for later. It will even sync those snippets across all your devices as long as you have extension syncing enabled (this is enabled by default in Chrome)

This extension has been published to the Chrome Web Store and is awaiting review. This readme will be updated when it is publically available.

### Give it a go

Install CodeYoink and try it out yourself:
`I am example code, click me`
